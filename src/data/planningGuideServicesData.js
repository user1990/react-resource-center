      'Since not all projects are alike, the time needed to produce them also varies. A simple press release may be completed in two weeks; writing and designing a large viewbook or two-minute video may take several months from concept through delivery. Please allow three weeks to design and print posters and flyers. Even if active time producing your project is only two weeks, you may need to get the word out about your event several months in advance to allow guests adequate time to plan to attend.\nPlease know that the MarCom Department has an extensive list of ongoing projects, so the more time you give us to assist you, the better we can meet your expectations and deadlines.\nIf you are planning a large campaign or project you should include the MarCom Department in your initial planning meetings. Even one year ahead is not too early to contact MarCom to develop marketing materials and publicity plans for a major event or campaign.\nIt limits our ability to help you when we are only given one or two months to assist with a large-scale project.'

      'In most cases, there is no charge for MarCom’s writing, photography, and editing services, nor for content creation for Web and social media. Hard costs, such as printing, however, must be met by the initiating department’s budget. Video recordings of campus talks require a set fee to cover SWOP costs. Advertising placement costs including TV, radio, print, Web, and social media also require funds from the initiating department. A MarCom representative will discuss specifics with you after you submit your project request.'

Mark any corrections on the proof, and send it back to MarCom as soon as possible. The publication will not be sent to print until a final sign off is given.'
